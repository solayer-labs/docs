# sSOL in DeFi

_There are various ways of utilizing sSOL and earning maximum yield as an sSOL holder. You can delegate to dApps to bootstrap network bandwidth or participate in DeFi strategies to earn additional APY, starting with our launch partners._

***

### Liquidity Provision on Orca

Orca utilizes a Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker (CLAMM) to enhance capital efficiency and yield for liquidity providers. By providing liquidity to Orca's pools, users can earn a yield on their crypto assets through trading fees.

When you provide liquidity to an Orca pool, such as the sSOL-SOL pair, you earn fees from each token swap within that pool. This means if you deposit sSOL and SOL into the pool, any trades that occur between these tokens will generate fees, which are distributed to you as a liquidity provider. Orca automates this process, ensuring optimal capital efficiency and low slippage.

**LP Example**

**Situation**: You have 100 sSOL worth $10,000. You want to earn a yield on your assets without active management.

**Use Case**: Deposit your sSOL and an equivalent amount of SOL into an Orca CLAMM pool. Your sSOL and SOL will provide liquidity to the DEX, earning fees from trading volume. Orcaâ€™s advanced CLAMM technology will ensure that your assets are utilized efficiently, maximizing your returns.

**Benefit**: Earn yield passively from trading fees while maintaining exposure to both sSOL and SOL.
