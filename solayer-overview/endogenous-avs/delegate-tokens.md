# Delegate Tokens

Solayer provides decentralized applications (dApps) with a simple method to create their own AVS LST. These tokens come with Solanaâ€™s native staking yield as their base rewards, along with additional MEV yields. Solayer optimizes the staking yield by delegating it to the highest yield-bearing validators. \
\
Additionally, Solayer runs its validator implementation that supports app-level stake-weighted quality of service provisioning. Moreover, dApps can receive a portion of the staking commission and will be able to configure the underlying operators for stake delegation in the future. The Solayer AVS Token is a delegated representation of sSOL, which is the Solayer-managed LST token on Solana.\
\
In the future, we envision dApps having direct control over the validators to which the underlying SOL is delegated. They should also be able to configure the required stake-weighted quality of service with a dynamic pricing mechanism depending on the current network workload.

### Getting an AVS Token&#x20;

First, users convert SOL into its natively staked form, sSOL. Staked SOL will be delegated to Solayer-recommended validators.&#x20;

They then delegate it to an endogenous dApp AVS on Solayer, which converts sSOL to a delegated form.&#x20;

Finally, Solayer AVS mints AVS tokens which can later be used as stake proof to retrieve staked SOL back and claim rewards.

### General Flow of sSOL

1. _**Deposit and Receive sSOL:**_

* Users deposit their stake into the native SOL pool and receive sSOL tokens in return.

2. _**Delegate sSOL:**_

* Restakers delegate their sSOL into the e-AVS (endogenous Actively Validated Services) pool and receive AVS wrapper SPL tokens.

3. _**Provision and Inclusion:**_

* e-AVS directly receives the delegated stake with an assigned validator, increasing the probability of block space provisioning and transaction inclusion.

4. _**Incentives:**_

* e-AVS can reward and incentivize more delegates to enhance participation.

5. _**Yield Commission:**_

* e-AVS earns a commission from the staking yield.
