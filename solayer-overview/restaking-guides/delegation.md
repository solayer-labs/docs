# Delegation

**The Solayer stake delegation process is straightforward:**

1. **Conversion:** Users convert SOL into its natively staked form, sSOL.
2. **Delegation:** Staked SOL is delegated to Solayer-recommended validators, which then delegate it to a Delegate dApp (endogenous AVS) on Solayer, converting sSOL to a delegated form.
3. **Minting Tokens: Solayer dApps** mint Delegate Tokens, which serve as stake proof to retrieve staked SOL and claim rewards.
