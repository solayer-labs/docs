Solayer is Solana's restaking protocol.

### Why use Solayer?

Solana users who have staked their SOL either natively or with a liquid staking service, and who are also seeking additional rewards on top of their staking rewards, may benefit from committing their already-staked assets to Solayer's restaking protocol. In doing so, they will contribute to the security of a multitude of decentralized applications which will each repay the favor with some reward for users.

Developers interested in creating new decentralized applications that require networks of validators may find that by using Solayer they can focus on building their applications instead of launching new trust networks from scratch. These services built with Solayer will also benefit from superior economic security than if they had launched their network of validators.
