### Liquid staking tokens

Liquid staking services are a wildly popular way for users who would like to stake their assets to receive a liquid token in exchange while their assets remain locked. These applications often serve an additional purpose as a way for users who don't have the minimum capital required to stake and become a validator to instead pool their capital with others to reach the minimum stake, and often also delegate the operation of the validator software to a third party. Solayer, in addition to supporting users who provide native SOL for staking and restaking, supports the restaking of several liquid staking tokens linked to already-staked SOL. As of now, the supported liquid staking tokens are JitoSOL, mSOL, and bSOL.

### Delegated AVS operation

Running software to validate a variety of AVS protocols is a task that is best left to sophisticated users who are capable of running the software efficiently and reducing the risk of service disruption. Users simply looking to receive rewards for committing their assets to be restaked may not be sufficiently sophisticated operators of AVS software to operate it safely. Or, users might simply prefer to avoid the inconvenience of running AVS software themselves.

In any case, it is possible for users restaking their assets to delegate the operation of AVS software to a sophisticated entity willing to operate the AVS software on their behalf.
