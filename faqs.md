## Introduction

#### What is Solayer?

Solayer is a restaking protocol built natively on Solana. Solayer leverages Solana’s economic security and premium execution as the decentralised cloud infrastructure to enable a higher degree of consensus and blockspace customization for application developers. \


#### This is done with 2 approaches:

a) Restaking is the most economical way to secure future distributed systems. Think of it as importing a library to create an economically secure POS efficiently.

b) Solayer restaking has two value propositions:

i. Securing exogenous AVSs, which are off-chain applications.

ii. Providing stake-weighted Quality of Service (QoS) Infrastructure for on-chain dApps (Endogenous AVSs)

#### Why should I use Solayer?

Trust is central to any ecosystem. However, in a PoS ecosystem, there must be an economically incentivized fair distribution of rewards to validators (or people delegating their tokens to validators). This is typically done in the form of newly minted tokens and requires participants to lock funds with an uncertain risk profile. This issue can be solved by shared security, which involves  a decentralised network of validators. Newer networks can then use the existing stake to gain economic guarantees and security.

As such, using Solayer enables its users to be part of this decentralised validator network and further increase the security and decentralisation of the Solana ecosystem.&#x20;

Users restaking with Solayer will be incentivized in the form of APY, earned by the validator with which they delegated their tokens. Using a re-staking protocol allows to compound the interests earned by

a) Staking SOL to a liquid staking protocol

b) Staking SOL LST to Solayer

#### How do I get started with Solayer?

a) Read the docs ([https://docs.solayer.org/solayer-docs](https://docs.solayer.org/solayer-docs)). This may be the most important thing to understand what solayer is about, and how one can interact with it. Then, don’t hesitate to ask any questions on the  Solayer Discord server.

b) If you are completely new to Solana. Check our Solayer 101 Academy and start learning from scratch. (Coming soon to our Discord - [discord.com/invite/solayerlabs](https://discord.com/invite/solayerlabs))



### Account Setup

How do I create a Solayer account?

a) 1st step is to go to the App (link ?) and connect your SVM wallet.

b) Then, connect your socials (X and Discord)

c) You’ll need an invite code to register, you can find them on the #codes channel.

d) Once connected, you’ll get 5 unique invite codes you can share with your friends or on your socials/#codes channel on the Solayer Discord.

e) Staking 10+ SOL will grant you access to a permanent referral code that you can share for unlimited time.

#### How to get Solayer Codes?

Codes can be found in the #codes channel on the Discord server. Alternatively, you can get some from friends, or people sharing those on social media (under @solayer\_labs posts for instance)

#### How to check my staking status?

a) On the dApp, click the « Restake » page on the top right corner (on the left of you wallet address)

b) You’ll be able to see directly on the dashboard (under the “Markets” tab your staking status

c) You can also check your deposit/withdrawals history in the “History” tab



### Staking Basics

#### What is staking?

a) Staking consists in depositing SOL to a protocol in exchange for APY. Your SOL is delegated to validators who’ll validate transactions on the Solana network and the APY is generated from the fees paid.

b) Some staking protocols issue a token when SOL is staked. This token is called a Liquid Staked Token (LST) and can be used as native Solana in DeFi protocols (lending, yield farming, liquidity pools, …). Such protocols are called Liquid Staking protocols. (Jito, Sanctum, Marinade …)

#### How do I start staking with Solayer?

Click the « deposit » button on the “Markets” tab on the dashboard. You can then choose how much you want to deposit.

#### What assets can I stake with Solayer?

1. You can stake Native Solana tokens. This token will be staked and you’ll receive sSOL-raw token (the Solayer LST) which will be restaked directly. In exchange, you’ll receive sSOL, the Solayer LRT (Liquid Restaked Token)
2. You can also stake LSTs from partner protocols. Currently those include Marinade (mSOL), Jito (JitoSOL), BlazeStake (bSOL) and Sanctum (INF). More will be added as Solayer develops. Each of these tokens issue a specific LRT.
3. We will be adding more assets over time.\


### Privacy and Security

#### Where can I find verified Solayer links?

a) On the Discord server #official-links channel

b) On the Solayer website ([https://solayer.org/](https://solayer.org/))

c) On the Solayer official X account (@solayer\_labs)

#### How are Solayer staking pools/users protected?

a) The Solayer contract ownership is shared with a multisig wallet. Out of 5 key holders, at least 3 confirmations are required to modify protocol-code upgrades. These keys are shared between the core team (2 keys) and 3 community seat holders.

b) Solayer is audited by Ottersec and will conduct two audits per year on all existing contracts.

c) Solayer also encourages its community members, technical hackers and researchers to comprehensively review the contracts and report to the mail address [report@solayer.org](mailto:report@solayer.org) or through the proper channels if bugs have been identified.



### Troubleshooting

#### What should I do if I'm experiencing issues?

a) When experiencing an issue, a user can ask, for simple questions, in the #general-chat for solutions from either the community or moderators

b) They can, at their own discretion or following a moderator’s suggestion open a support ticket (In Discord)

#### Where can I get updates about Solayer?

a) Updates on Solayer can be found on the #announcement channel on the Solayer Discord server

b) By following the official X account @solayer\_labs

c) Through the #posts channel on the Solayer Discord server



#### Where can I find more help if I need it?

a) Help may be found within the community in #general-chat. It can come from community members, moderators or team members (if available?)

b) Users may also open #support tickets



#### If you have any other questions please feel free to open a ticket in our Discord and a member of our team will be in touch!
