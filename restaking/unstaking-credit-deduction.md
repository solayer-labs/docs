# Unstaking Credit Deduction

The credit deduction mechanism is designed to manage the rewards earned through staked SOL, ensuring fair distribution and reward long term community members. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works.

## Accounting Deduction

When you stake SOL (or any other LST on Solayer) in a pool, you earn accrue credits based on the amount and type (bSOL, jitoSOL, INF, mSOL, etc.) of SOL staked. However, if you withdraw your staked SOL before the final epoch, a portion of that will deducted. This mechanism ensures that long-term stakers are rewarded more than those who withdraw early.

### Calculation

1. **Base Rate**: The base rate for every SOL staked&#x20;
2. **Time weight**: Hourly&#x20;
3. **Multipliers**:

* Native SOL (significantly higher priority)
* Basic Liquid Staking Tokens

### Deduction Rules

* **Withdraw Amount:** If you withdraw a certain percentage of your staked SOL, the credits associated with that percentage of SOL will be subject to deducted.
* **Deduction Percentage:** 50% of the rewards generated by the withdrawn amount will be deducted.

## Examples

### _**Example 1: Withdrawing 10% of Staked SOL**_

* **Staked SOL:** 100 SOL
* **Withdrawn SOL:** 10 SOL (10% of 100 SOL)
* **Credits Earned:** 1000  (for simplicity, assume all are native SOL with 4x multiplier applied)
* **Deduction: (10 / 100 \* 1000) \* 0.5 = 50 credits**

So, if you generated 1000 credits on the 10 SOL deposited, 500 credits will be deducted, leaving you with 500 credits.

### _**Example 2: Withdrawing 20% of Staked SOL**_

* **Staked SOL:** 50 SOL
* **Withdrawn SOL:** 10 SOL (20% of 50 SOL)
* **Credits Earned:** 300 credits (assuming a mix of native SOL and LSTs, with appropriate multipliers)
* **Deduction: (10 / 50 \* 300) \* 0.5 = 30 credits**

In this case, if you generated 300 creditson the 10 SOL deposited, 30 credits will be deducted, leaving you with 270 credits.

### _**Example 3: Withdrawing 50% of Staked SOL**_

* **Staked SOL:** 20 SOL
* **Withdrawn SOL:** 10 SOL (50% of 20 SOL)
* **Credits Earned:** 600 (assuming native SOL with 4x multiplier)
* **Deduction: (10 / 20 \* 600) \* 0.5 = 150 credits**

Here, if you generated 600 credits on the 10 SOL deposited, 150 credits will be deducted, leaving you with 450 credits.
