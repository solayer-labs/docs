# Key Terms and Concepts



1. **Liquid Staking Token (LST):** A token representing a staked asset that remains liquid, allowing holders to participate in DeFi activities without unstaking.
2. **Liquid Restaking Token (LRT):** A token representing a restaked asset that maintains liquidity, enabling holders to engage in decentralized finance while the asset is restaked.
3. **Restaking:** The process of staking an already staked asset on a different network or protocol to enhance security and earn additional rewards.
4. **Liquid Restaking Basket:** A collection of liquid restaking tokens that allows investors to diversify their restaked assets while maintaining liquidity.
5. **Shared Validator Network:** A network of validators that pool resources to secure multiple blockchains, increasing efficiency and security.
6. **sSOL:** A specific token that represents staked Solana (SOL) in a liquid staking protocol, allowing holders to earn staking rewards while maintaining liquidity.
7. **Slashing:** A penalty mechanism in proof-of-stake networks where a portion of a validator's stake is forfeited for malicious behavior or network violations.
8. **Restake Withdrawal:** The process of withdrawing assets from a restaking position, typically involving the conversion of liquid restaking tokens back into the original asset.
9. **Withdrawal Delay:** The time period required for the withdrawal process to complete, often implemented to ensure network security.
10. **Deposit:** The act of placing assets into a staking or restaking protocol to earn rewards and participate in network security.
11. **Unrestake:** The process of removing assets from a restaking position, converting liquid restaking tokens back into the original asset.
12. **Restake Points:** Points or credits earned through restaking that may influence rewards, governance, or other aspects of the protocol.
13. **Unstake Penalty:** A penalty incurred for unstaking or unrestaking assets before a specified period, often implemented to ensure network stability.
14. **AVS (Actively Validated Services): A**ny system that requires unique distributed validation methods for verification.
15. **Exogenous AVS:** Systems that maintain off-chain networks and use to establish consensus on security via quorum-based slashing or on-chain verifiable proof. Examples of exogenous AVSs include cross-chain bridges, shared sequencers, oracle networks, among others.
16. **Endogenous AVS:** Instead of focusing on exogenous AVSs, Solayer aims to support on-chain decentralized applications (dApps) initially. The goal is to provide dApps on Solana with a greater likelihood of securing block space and prioritizing transaction inclusion.
17. **Stake-weighted Quality of Service (QoS):** Refers to the allocation of network resources, such as block space and transaction processing capacity, based on the amount of stake committed by validators or stakers.
