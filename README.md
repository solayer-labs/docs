Solayer is building the restaking network natively on Solana.&#x20;

Solana serves as the internet layer, facilitating the seamless movement of data, trust, and money. Solayer leverages Solana’s economic security and superior execution capabilities as a decentralized cloud infrastructure, enabling application developers to achieve a higher degree of consensus and block space customization.

To realize this, Solayer uses a two-pronged approach:&#x20;

1. **Restaking**: ‌leverage the economic security of SOL to secure other systems.
2. **Shared Validator Network**: Solana-centric networks sharing Solana security and infrastructure.
