# Multisigature Committees

The Solayer contract is inherently upgradable for several reasons. Firstly, stage 1 will be released in multiple phases, necessitating contract upgrades. Secondly, in emergencies, the core team must be able to swiftly implement proactive changes. Lastly, to ensure transparency and a community-first approach, the Solayer core team has decided to decentralize the development process. Hence, contract ownership is migrated to a multisig of known individuals within the Solana community.

**Multisig Address**: GcYvLKKEWpxQMqFe9HUcDJYMGvXt7kwf8gfBvjnW4wnm

**Program**: sSo1iU21jBrU9VaJ8PJib1MtorefUV4fzC9GURa2KNn

The upgradability of the Solayer contract is overseen by trusted community leaders. Initially, we have selected 3 out of the 5 multisig seat holders, with one seat occupied by the Solayer core team. To maintain our commitment to transparency and a community-first approach, we will gather community feedback to appoint 1 more community member to the governing seat. Candidates will be evaluated diligently following a public forum, and more information will be released soon.

This multisig controls protocol-code upgrades. To modify our program, the multisig must have a 3 out of 5 quorum signing to approve any upgrade. Solayer core team may conduct a forum to discuss potential increase or decrease of seat holders and quorum threshold. This is to ensure no one can act maliciously and can be immediately stopped by others.&#x20;

**Below are the first 3 community seat holders, out of 5 in total.**
